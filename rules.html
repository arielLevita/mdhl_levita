            <h4>SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
            <p>
              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

            <h4>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span class="uppercase">dimensions.ihf</span> Law 1 provides for
                flexible external field dimensions within a given maximum and
                minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to
                for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="uppercase">competition fields</span> Fields used
                within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60
                yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the
                state competition program that are unable to provide a field
                that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
                inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
                waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="uppercase">fields used by young age groups</span>
                <ol class="list-alpha">
                  <li>
                    U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                    penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                    progressively larger.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards

                    internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.

            <h4>ALL-PLAY</h4>
            <p>
              All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall
              play atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the
              competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of
              each game.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
                under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
                practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
                games, and injuries.
